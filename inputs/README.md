Created repo with inputs folder, created gw_names.txt with names of events used in GWTC-3 analyses. This is copied from an output of April's notebook, which I've checked 
(see AMAZE_project_resources/gwtc3_events/event_names.ipynb) contains the same list of events as the processed events in April's data release. Will use these events to generate processed events for runs.
